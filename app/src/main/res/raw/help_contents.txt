<ul>
  <li>Go to Settings Tab </li>
  <li>Turn on the Location and Measurement Switch </li>
  <li>Turn on the "Screen Always ON" Switch </li>
  <li>Wait for the Display Message "GNSS Measurement are Available" (displayed when more than 4 satellites are available for logging) </li>
  <li>Go to Sensor Tab </li>
  <li>Turn ON the "Log RNX + Sensor Data" Switch </li>
  <li>Turn OFF the "Log RNX + Sensor Data" Switch to stop logging</li>
  <li>Go to your device storage root directory </li>
  <li>Open "GNSS-IMU Logger" folder</li>
  <li>Open "IMU_Log" folder inside "GNSS-IMU Logger" folder and your IMU log file is located there </li>
  <li>Open "Rinex_Log" folder inside "GNSS-IMU Logger" folder and your Rinex log file is located there </li>
  <li>Convert the Sensor output file (ASCII) to .mif format or .imr format using MATLAB Tool to process with MuSNAT or Inertial Explorer respectively</li>

<h3>Code Minus Carrier Plot</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Go to Settings Tab </li>
  <li>Turn on the Location and Measurement Switch </li>
  <li>Turn on the "Screen Always ON" Switch </li>
  <li>Wait for the Display Message "GNSS Measurement are Available" (displayed when more than 4 satellites are available for logging) </li>
  <li>Go to GNSS Tab and Press "RNX LOG" button to start the logging</li>
  <li>Go to the CMC Plot tab for visualization </li>
  <li>"Code Minus Carrier (m)" plot shows a "line" for each satellite without any cycle slip on the current epoch. If a cycle slip occur, it will be indicated by a "sphere" and will reset. </li>
  <li>"Code Minus Carrier Normalized (m)" plot shows a "line" for each satellite without any cycle slip on the current epoch. the cycle slip is indicated by a a gap in the line. All the CMC values are normalized with first CMC values (no-cycle slip) for each individual satellite.</li>
</ul>
